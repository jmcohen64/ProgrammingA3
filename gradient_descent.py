def find_global_minimum(f, x0, learning_rate=0.1, tol=1e-6):
    """
    Find global minimum of a function f which is admits the following syntax:
       y, grad = f(x)
    where y is the value of the function at x and grad is its gradient at x.

    Parameters:
    f (callable):          A strictly convex function
    x0 (float|tuple|list): Initial approximation
    learning_rate (float): The learning rate
    tol (float):           Stopping condition constant

    Returns:
    - (float|tuple): An approximate minimum
    - (float): The value of f at the minimum

    Raises: May throw appropriate exceptions.
